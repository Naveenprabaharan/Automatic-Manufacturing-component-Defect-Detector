## Automatic Manufacturing component Defect Detector
The purpose of this project is to detect DEFECT Product using computer vision. 
This project will help different organizations for detecting defect component i.e. Dia of pipe , size of the component. 
By using this technology, we can create Quality product and this reduces the Manpower and increase the production rate.

## Scope
This project can be used in different organizations where manufacturing product should have high accuracy and where 
accuracy need to be maintain. The organization can use this project to find out whether the component is Defect product or not. 
Similarly, this can be used for any type Manufacturing defect identification.
